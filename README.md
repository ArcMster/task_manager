# task_manager
This is a task management web application which allows all users to add, update and review their tasks. 
A superuser can review and add comments to the tasks created by all users.
Superuser will receive real time notification when a user add/update/delete a task.
This application also creates excel sheets of tasks on a weekly basis on every sunday at 9:30 am. 
We can add/update the location in which the excel sheets will be stored by adding/updating a location to Locations table which is accessible from the admin page.
If multiple locations are added, the excel sheets will be stored in all the locations.
